<h1>Excercise for ngRedux</h1>
<p>This is a simple todo application implemented using AngularJS 1.6.1. In the actual implementation the Redux and ngRedux are not used (though the libraries are included, so you don't have to bother with that).</p>
<p>Fork this pen, and transform the application so that it uses only ngRedux for state management! (so the components cannot contain any properties or methods on their own)</p>
